This version of the X# Compiler comes with a compiler in both Debug mode and Release mode.
By default the compiler will run in Release mode, which should give a MUCH better performance.
However, if you are experiencing strange compiler crashes, we recommend that you copy the files 
from the Bin\Debug folder into the Bin folder and test again. Most likely you will then
get assertion errors in stead of mysterious crashes.
These assertion errors may help us locate the cause of the problem.

If you want to switch back to the Release version of the compiler, you can copy the files from 
the Bin\Release folder to the Bin folder.
